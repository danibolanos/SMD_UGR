# Data Warehouse PDI/Mondrian Project

Development of a project with multidimensional analysis tools. Using [PowerQuery](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-query/) for data pre-processing. Implementation of the ETL schema using the [Spoon](https://help.hitachivantara.com/Documentation/Pentaho/8.1/Products/Data_Integration/PDI_Client) software from Kettle. Finally using [Mondrian](https://mondrian.pentaho.com/documentation/index.php) as the engine of the OLAP component and JRubik to generate different queries on the implemented multidimensional schema.
